CommandBook
===========

CommandBook adds general commands for Bukkit.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

    mvn package install
    
Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
